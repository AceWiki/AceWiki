c Changelog:~n- Moved from version 2 to version 3 of the Echo Web Framework. This makes AceWiki more stable and~n  gives more options for the future. However, there are some minor issues:~n  - The ACE Editor does not react on certain keystrokes anymore, e.g. key up/down for selecting the~n    previous/next item.~n  - When a statement menu is opened using the Opera browser, unnecessary scrolling takes place.~n- Major changes of the predictive editor:~n  - The menu blocks have different colors to emphasize their different types.~n  - The menu blocks are now arranged in several columns of one or more blocks. Before, they were~n    arranged in one or two rows.~n  - A new algorithm is implemented to arrange the menu blocks.~n- New versions for the following third-party libraries: OWL API, OWLlink and HermiT.~n- The logic page for AceWiki now shows a pretty-printed OWL/FSS syntax instead of OWL/XML.~n- Some bugs have been fixed:~n  - The menu items for comments did not check whether the user was logged in.~n  - Enlarged menu blocks of the predictive editor did not show all menu entries.~n  - The external XStream library has been added, which seems to be required in some situations.~n  - Pressing enter closes messages if no decision is required.~n  - The alphabetical sorting on the individuals page in AceWiki now ignores the initial "the".~n  - In the ACE Editor, comparative transitive adjectives with objects did not work properly.~n- General refactoring and clean-up.~n- Other minor bugs have been fixed.

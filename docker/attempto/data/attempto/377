c Abstract: Logic-based controlled natural languages usually provide some facility for compositional representation, minimally including sentence level coordination and sometimes subordination. These forms of compositional representation are useful for expressing short passages of a few sentences, but compared to natural language they offer only a limited range of expression, and they are unwieldy for expressing longer passages. This paper describes a method for bringing more naturalness to controlled natural languages. This approach defines a model for representing compositional structures found in natural language, such as Antithesis, Concession, and Unless in a way that is both rhetorically expressive and logically reducible. This is demonstrated through a series of examples using both natural and controlled natural language. The paper then describes a set of intercompositional rules of inference that can be used to reason about the interrelationships between compositional structures, facilitating the discovery and assessment of supportive and conflicting relationships among them. This ability to represent and discover interrelationships among discourse representation structures could be useful for developing applications that must not only follow a set of rules of inference, but reason about the rules themselves.

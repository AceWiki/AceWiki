c Abstract: First-order logic (FOL) is undecidable â€” that is, no algorithm exists that can decide whether a formula of FOL is valid or not. However, there are various fragments of FOL that are known to be decidable. FO2, the two-variable fragment of FOL, is one of such languages [1,2]. FO2 is a first-order language where formulas have maximally two variables, no function symbols, but possibly do have equality. FO2 has the finite model property [1], which means that if a formula of FO2 is satisfiable, it is satisfiable in a finite model.

ACEWIKI TODO-LIST
=================

General:
( ) Documentation and help pages
(X) URL for each article with "?showpage=Article"
( ) "ask a question" feature
( ) Strange error happens sometimes: "[error occurred during error reporting, step 0, id 0xa]"
( ) Import of ontologies
( ) Include lexical meta information for OWL export so that it can be imported nicely in ACE View
( ) AceWiki gets slow after some time when many sentences are added (but is fast again after a restart)
( ) Support different subsets of OWL (e.g. EL, QL, RL) in order to make reasoning faster
( ) Pressing the enter key should perform "OK" in message windows
(X) Use of ch.uzh.ifi.attempto.acewiki.Task instead of ch.uzh.ifi.attempto.echocomp.DelayedComponent
( ) Context parameter in the web.xml file for defining the path where the directories "logs" and "data" should be created
(X) Questions like "what is Switzerland?" should return the classes of the individual
( ) Meta statements in ACE, e.g: "country" is a noun.
( ) Asynchronous creation/deletion/reassertion of statements
( ) Switching UNA on/off in web.xml
( ) SWRL export
(X) Modification tasks take precedence over query tasks

Grammar:
( ) "the ... of"
( ) Word classes:
   ( ) Intransitive Verbs
   ( ) Intransitive Adjectives
( ) Saxon genitive
( ) "Which countries are an area?" does not work
( ) Numbers and strings (data properties in OWL)
( ) "thing" for top concept

Editor/Creator:
( ) Take the content of the text field if "New ..." is pressed, and take this as default for the word form
( ) Key listener. Tab key should not be necessary.
( ) Bug: Pressing the Tab key moves the cursor to the beginning of the text in IE7
( ) The word editor should make suggestions for plural word forms etc.
( ) Better help in the predictive editor why certain words are not possible
( ) Some lookahead of more than one step in the predictive editor?
( ) Edit in the middle of a sentence

Wiki pages:
( ) Support for independent pages (that are not attached to an ontological entity)
( ) Cut/Copy/Paste
(X) Support for links to other articles in the comments
(X) Support for web links in the comments
( ) Internal links in comments should be treated as references.
( ) Hierarchy browsing
(X) Tooltips for the different kinds of triangle symbols
( ) "edit" and "delete" buttons are probably at the wrong place
( ) Improve word tab, or remove it and show the word table at top right of the main page

ACEWIKI TODO-LIST
=================

Legend:
(*) Filed as bug on Launchpad
(+) Filed as blueprint on Launchpad
(?) Unknown whether still valid
(X) Solved

General:
( ) Documentation and help pages
( ) "ask a question" feature
(?) Strange error happens sometimes: "[error occurred during error reporting, step 0, id 0xa]"
(+) Import of ontologies
(+) Include lexical meta information for OWL export so that it can be imported nicely in ACE View
(*) AceWiki gets slow after some time when many sentences are added (but is fast again after a restart)
( ) Support different subsets of OWL (e.g. EL, QL, RL) in order to make reasoning faster
(*) Pressing the enter key should perform "OK" in message windows
( ) Context parameter in the web.xml file for defining the path where the directories "logs" and "data" should be created
( ) Meta statements in ACE, e.g: "country" is a noun.
( ) Asynchronous creation/deletion/reassertion of statements
( ) Switching UNA on/off in web.xml
(+) SWRL export

Grammar:
(+) "the ... of"
(+) Word classes:
   (+) Intransitive Verbs
   (+) Intransitive Adjectives
(+) Saxon genitive
(*) "Which countries are an area?" does not work
(+) Numbers and strings (data properties in OWL)
( ) "thing" for top concept

Editor/Creator:
(+) Take the content of the text field if "New ..." is pressed, and take this as default for the word form
(+) Key listener. Tab key should not be necessary.
(?) Bug: Pressing the Tab key moves the cursor to the beginning of the text in IE7
(+) The word editor should make suggestions for plural word forms etc.
(+) Better help in the predictive editor why certain words are not possible
(+) Some lookahead of more than one step in the predictive editor?
(+) Edit in the middle of a sentence

Wiki pages:
(+) Support for independent pages (that are not attached to an ontological entity)
(+) Cut/Copy/Paste
( ) Internal links in comments should be treated as references.
( ) Hierarchy browsing
( ) "edit" and "delete" buttons are probably at the wrong place
( ) Improve word tab, or remove it and show the word table at top right of the main page

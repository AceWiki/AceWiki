AceWiki Change Log
------------------

This file lists the changes between the different AceWiki versions. See the Bazaar log for more
details.


Version 0.4.0:

- Moved from version 2 to version 3 of the OWL API.
- Moved from OWL 1.1 to OWL 2.
- HermiT is used instead of Pellet as default reasoner (because of license reasons). Pellet is
  still supported but is not part of the AceWiki package anymore.
- Support for OWLlink added. In this way, other reasoners like FaCT++ or RacerPro can be used.
- New web.xml parameters:
  - owl_profile: restricts the reasoning on statements that are part of a certain OWL profile.
  - global_restrictions_policy: defines how the global restrictions of OWL 2 should be enforced.
  - readonly: allows for launching an AceWiki instance that cannot make changes on the ontology.
  - possible_answers: an experimental feature that enables to show possible answers, i.e.
    individuals that cannot be proven not to be an answer.
- Sentences can now be manually retracted from reasoning without being removed from the wiki.
- Sentences that do not participate in reasoning are now consistently displayed in red font.
  Before, this was only the case for sentences that violated at some point the consistency of the
  knowledge base.
- Improved dropdown menus:
  - Tooltips for the menu entries.
  - Reordering of the menu entries.
- A new "About" page has been added with information about the given wiki instance.
- The predictive editor has been improved:
  - Improved calculation of the content of the menu blocks.
  - Better implementation of the asynchronous menu creation.
- Refactoring of the ontology classes of AceWiki.
- New export feature for AceWiki: The wiki content can now be downloaded as two CSV lists (one
  containing the entities and another one containing the statements).
- Unix shell script added to run the web applications with Jetty Runner.
- Simple progress bar on the standard error channel when an AceWiki ontology is being loaded.


Version 0.3.1:

- The code was extracted from the Attempto Java Packages (no functional changes), including the
  packages "attempto-echo", "attempto-chartparser", "attempto-aceeditor", "attempto-acewiki", but
  without the packages "attempto-ape" and "attempto-owl".

AceWiki Change Log
------------------

This file lists the changes between the different AceWiki versions. See the Git log for more
details.


Version 0.5.2

- The AceWiki repository moved from Launchpad to GitHub, and thereby from Bazaar to Git.
- The package structure has changed, with several new packages. See README.md for the details.
- There is a new interface that enables the use of other predictive parsers besides the Codeco
  chart-parser.
- Redesign of the engine/language interfaces to support multilinguality: AceWikiEngine is the main
  interface (language-independent). LanguageHandler is the interface for language-specific
  behavior.
- Experimental GF engine as an alternative to the ACE-OWL engine: It uses GF (Grammatical
  Framework) to allow for automatic translations into other languages. The current prototype uses
  a very simple "Foods" grammar for English, German and Italian. The GF engine is in a very early
  stage of development and very buggy. Reasoning is not supported at the moment.
- AceWiki applications can now be split into backends and frontends: Multiple frontends can connect
  to the same backend, i.e. to the same ontology. See web.xml for the details.
- jpl.jar (Java binding for SWI Prolog) is no longer part of the AceWiki package. Instead, AceWiki
  needs to directly access the library of the given SWI Prolog installation with a Java argument of
  the form "-Djava.library.path=/path/to/swipl/" pointing to the location of jpl.jar.
- New AceWiki data format (for export/import): The new format includes IDs and links of the form
  "<element-id,word-id>". It now corresponds to the internal format of the file-based storage, is
  more general, and should be more stable. The old format is still supported for the time being.
- The ACE parser (APE) can now be connected in three different ways: "local" (via jpl.jar),
  "socket" or "webservice".
- Internal refactoring, clean-up, and improvements (concerning serialization, manager/engine
  classes, chart-parser interface, and more)
- Simplification of ontology classes
- More minor bug-fixes, improvements, refactoring, and clean-up


Version 0.5.1

- Stay-logged-in feature: users have the option to stay logged in, eliminating the need to provide
  the password again the next time if AceWiki is accessed from the same browser instance.
- Internal refactoring: the code for ACE and OWL is now separated from the core package and placed
  in a new package called "aceowl". In this way, AceWiki can be extended in the future to support
  other controlled natural languages and other logic formalisms.
- Logic page and details page for AceWiki sentences have been merged.
- web.xml file has new configuration parameters:
  - logdir: defines the server directory for the log files.
  - datadir: defines the server directory for the AceWiki data.
  - reasoner_url: defines the URL and port number of the reasoner (at the moment, this applies only
    to the OWLlink reasoner interface).
- Some files have been renamed:
  - The names for the packages acewiki.jar and aceeditor.jar no longer contain version numbers.
  - The web archive file webapps.war has been renamed to acewiki.war.
- Problem with image files solved: the same image is no longer downloaded multiple times.
- There are several minor GUI adjustments.
- Several bugs have been fixed.


Version 0.5.0

- Moved from version 2 to version 3 of the Echo Web Framework. This makes AceWiki more stable and
  gives more options for the future. However, there are some minor issues:
  - The ACE Editor does not react on certain keystrokes anymore, e.g. key up/down for selecting the
    previous/next item.
  - When a statement menu is opened using the Opera browser, unnecessary scrolling takes place.
- Major changes of the predictive editor:
  - The menu blocks have different colors to emphasize their different types.
  - The menu blocks are now arranged in several columns of one or more blocks. Before, they were
    arranged in one or two rows.
  - A new algorithm is implemented to arrange the menu blocks.
- New versions for the following third-party libraries: OWL API, OWLlink and HermiT.
- The logic page for AceWiki now shows a pretty-printed OWL/FSS syntax instead of OWL/XML.
- Some bugs have been fixed:
  - The menu items for comments did not check whether the user was logged in.
  - Enlarged menu blocks of the predictive editor did not show all menu entries.
  - The external XStream library has been added, which seems to be required in some situations.
  - Pressing enter closes messages if no decision is required.
  - The alphabetical sorting on the individuals page in AceWiki now ignores the initial "the".
  - In the ACE Editor, comparative transitive adjectives with objects did not work properly.
- General refactoring and clean-up.
- Other minor bugs have been fixed.


Version 0.4.4

- The individual menu blocks of the predictive editor can now be enlarged for better usability in
  the case of long words.
- Many bugs have been fixed:
  - DLSafeRule elements in the new OWL representation caused errors.
  - Creating new words in AceWiki was possible without login.
  - Line wrapping for article titles did not work.
  - Wiki links in comments did not work as expected.
  - Blanks were displayed as underscores in the title of sentence pages.
  - The predictive editor in AceWiki failed to detect multi-word tokens in a case-insensitive way.
  - There were a number of problems of the AceWiki grammar regarding questions:
    - Some sentences with question words could be created that cannot be completed.
    - Questions with more than one question word were allowed, which cannot be answered.
    - Questions containing "every" were allowed, which cannot be answered either.
    - Questions like "which areas are a country?" work now.
  - Invalid expressions like "at least 1 countries" were possible because of a bug in the lexicon
    handlers.
  - Editing sentences on the start page caused an error.
  - Deleted pages are now removed from the browsing history.
- Some more minor refactoring and code improvement.


Version 0.4.3

- There are no word tabs anymore in AceWiki. The word information is accessed by clicking on the
  article title.
- The main page of AceWiki is now a wiki article.
- The search field of AceWiki has moved to the top right.
- Extensions of the internal Codeco grammar notation.
  - Codeco rules can have annotations.
  - Codeco grammars can produce parse/syntax trees and semantic representations.
- Design improvement of the chart parser and the predictive editor: dynamic lexicon management and
  menu creation is now clearly separated.
- Interface polishing: Nicer icons for AceWiki and small modifications of the interface colors.
- The OWL RDF option has been removed from the ACE Editor, because it is deprecated.
- Internal refactoring and improvements at various places.


Version 0.4.2

- Proper user login with password protection is now possible and can be configured with the
  following web.xml parameters:
  - login: defines whether login features are enabled or not
  - login_required: defines whether login is required for viewing, only for editing, or not at all.
  - register: defines whether registration is open to everyone.
- GUI improvements:
  - Icons for back/forward/refresh buttons.
  - Modified icons to represent individuals/concepts/relations.
  - New GUI elements for login and logout.
  - And other minor improvements.
- The start page of the exemplary web application server has been improved.
- Some syntactical improvements of the AceWiki and ACE Editor grammars.
- Better synchronization of the classes Sentence and Ontology.
- Minor code clean-up and improvement.


Version 0.4.1:

- Two memory leaks (in the broad sense, as they can also occur with Java) have been fixed:
  - References to closed windows were internally retained, which prevented them (and the objects
    they referenced) from being garbage collected.
  - References to the closed application instances were retained.
- There is a new AceWiki data format, in which the wiki content can be exported (on the client-
  side) and imported (on the server-side).
- The test scripts for the two grammars are included.
- Some minor improvements of the Latex and HTML outputs of the Codeco transformation.
- One small bug in the grammars has been fixed.
- The internals of the Ontology class have been improved.


Version 0.4.0:

- Moved from version 2 to version 3 of the OWL API.
- Moved from OWL 1.1 to OWL 2.
- HermiT is used instead of Pellet as default reasoner (because of license reasons). Pellet is
  still supported but is not part of the AceWiki package anymore.
- Support for OWLlink added. In this way, other reasoners like FaCT++ or RacerPro can be used.
- New web.xml parameters:
  - owl_profile: restricts the reasoning on statements that are part of a certain OWL profile.
  - global_restrictions_policy: defines how the global restrictions of OWL 2 should be enforced.
  - readonly: allows for launching an AceWiki instance that cannot make changes on the ontology.
  - possible_answers: an experimental feature that enables to show possible answers, i.e.
    individuals that cannot be proven not to be an answer.
- Sentences can now be manually retracted from reasoning without being removed from the wiki.
- Sentences that do not participate in reasoning are now consistently displayed in red font.
  Before, this was only the case for sentences that violated at some point the consistency of the
  knowledge base.
- Improved dropdown menus:
  - Tooltips for the menu entries.
  - Reordering of the menu entries.
- A new "About" page has been added with information about the given wiki instance.
- The predictive editor has been improved:
  - Improved calculation of the content of the menu blocks.
  - Better implementation of the asynchronous menu creation.
- Refactoring of the ontology classes of AceWiki.
- New export feature for AceWiki: The wiki content can now be downloaded as two CSV lists (one
  containing the entities and another one containing the statements).
- Unix shell script added to run the web applications with Jetty Runner.
- Simple progress bar on the standard error channel when an AceWiki ontology is being loaded.


Version 0.3.1:

- The code was extracted from the Attempto Java Packages (no functional changes), including the
  packages "attempto-echo", "attempto-chartparser", "attempto-aceeditor", "attempto-acewiki", but
  without the packages "attempto-ape" and "attempto-owl".
